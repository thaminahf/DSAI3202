## 5.d. Explain and Run the Algorithm (5 pts)

### ðŸ”¹ Explanation of genetic_algorithm_trial.py
The script genetic_algorithm_trial.py implements a **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** to optimize city routes. It uses **MPI parallelization** to improve efficiency. Below are the key steps:

1 **Initialize Population**:  
   - A population of random valid routes is generated.  
   - Each process (MPI rank) gets a subset of the population.  

2 **Evaluate Fitness**:  
   - Each process **calculates fitness** (total route distance) for its assigned routes.  
   - Results are **gathered at rank 0** to determine the best solution.  

3 **Selection, Crossover & Mutation**:  
   - **Tournament selection** chooses the best routes.  
   - **Order crossover** is applied to create new routes.  
   - **Mutation** swaps cities to maintain diversity.  

4 **Stagnation Handling**:  
   - If no improvement for multiple generations, mutation rate **increases adaptively**.  

5 **Final Evaluation**:  
   - The best route is selected at rank 0.  
   - If invalid, it is **fixed by removing duplicates & adding missing cities**.  
   - **Total distance** is calculated for comparison.

## 6 Parallelizing the Code (20 pts)

###  Defining Distributed and Parallelized Parts (5 pts)

To efficiently parallelize the genetic algorithm, we distribute the following parts:

1. **Fitness Evaluation** 
   - Each MPI process evaluates the fitness of a subset of the population.
   - This reduces computational load per process.

2. **Population Management**  
   - Each process maintains a portion of the population.
   - The best solutions are shared among processes for improved convergence.

3. **Selection, Crossover, and Mutation**   
   - Performed independently on local populations.
   - Reduces bottlenecks by avoiding redundant communication.

4. **Synchronization and Communication**   
   - The best fitness values are gathered at rank 0 to guide evolution.
   - The updated population is broadcasted for uniformity.

###  Parallelization of the Program (10 pts)

MPI is used for parallel execution:

- **MPI Initialization**   
  - The script initializes MPI, determining the number of available processes.
  - The rank (process ID) determines which portion of the population each process handles.

- **Parallel Fitness Calculation**   
  - Each process evaluates the fitness of its assigned routes.
  - Results are gathered and the best fitness is identified.

- **Parallel Genetic Operations**  
  - Each process independently applies selection, crossover, and mutation to its sub-population.
  - Ensures efficient utilization of computational resources.

- **Population Synchronization**  
  - Rank 0 collects and merges the best solutions.
  - The updated population is broadcast to all processes.

- Adjust **crossover and mutation operations** to ensure **balanced car assignments**.

###  **Approach 2: Task Partitioning with MPI**
