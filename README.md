# Tumor Detection using Image Processing

## Overview
This project applies image processing techniques to detect tumors in medical scans.

## Methods Used
- Image Preprocessing (grayscale conversion, noise reduction)
- Edge Detection & Segmentation
- Machine Learning Classification:
  

## Results
- Successfully identified tumor regions in images.
- The model achieved X% accuracy in detection.

- Improve accuracy by fine-tuning parameters.
- Train on a larger dataset for better generalization.
