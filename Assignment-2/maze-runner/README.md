## How to Play

### Manual Mode
1. Controls:
- Use the arrow keys to move the player (<span style="color:blue">blue circle</span>)

## Student Questions and Answers

### Answer to Question 1

The automated maze explorer uses a sophisticated combination of the right-hand rule algorithm with backtracking to solve mazes. Through testing with different maze configurations (random, static, and varying sizes), we can observe the following key aspects:

1. **Algorithm Used by the Explorer**
- When implementing the right-hand rule algorithm, the explorer emphasizes turning right whenever possible and attempts to proceed if turning right is prevented.

- A left turn is attempted if forward is barred.
- Initiates backtracking if all directions are blocked.

2. **Loop Detection and Handling**
- To find loops, the explorer keeps track of the locations it has visited:
- tracks the cells that have been visited in a 2D array; when a position is returned, it is shown as being a part of a loop.
- The explorer then attempts other routes to escape the loop, which guarantees advancement and avoids endless loops.

3. **Backtracking Strategy**
When the explorer gets stuck, it uses a systematic backtracking approach:
- Maintains a stack of previous positions and decisions
- When backtracking, it:
  - Pops the last position from the stack
  - Tries alternative paths from that position
  - Marks dead ends to avoid revisiting them
  - Continues until a new path is found

4. **Performance Statistics**
At the end of the exploration, the explorer presents comprehensive statistics, including:
- The total duration required to solve the maze
- The complete count of moves executed
- The number of times backtracking occurred
- The average number of moves per second
- Whether the exploration was successful or not
- The length of the path leading to the solution

### Question 2 (30 points)
Implement a parallel version of the maze explorer using MPI (Message Passing Interface). Your implementation should:
1. Run multiple explorers simultaneously on different processes
